# Senior-Seminar-Machavaram

I was creating a generic schedule of when all the seminars are in the day. That means that the day would show the times and the 5 seminars during 5 time periods duirng the seminar day, and that means that some of the class rooms will be empty during this times that some are going to be there. Then, the students will be placed based on the generic schedule. More plans and thoghts to come in the near future.

Didn't do much in the coding environment. but still had to do some pseudocode on paper. The pseudocode was working on creating a broader schedule of all the seminars that will be going on during the day, as well as when and where they will occur. I have also been working on figuring out which ones were the most popular, in order to fill some of the blank spaces in the scudele, so that the popular courses will run twice. I just need some assistance with the technicality portion of this project, but a pkan is slowly starting to form, and I think I am on the rigth track, but I just need to get some help with the code portion. Will come see you for both aid in planning and the code, probably during extra help. Thanks!
